# COMPLETE CONCILIAR VOCABULARY COMPENDIUM

## ΒΊΒΛΟΣ ΛΌΓΟΥ Theological Reference

This document specifies the exact theological vocabulary forged in the Seven Ecumenical Councils, providing the authoritative terminology for Orthodox Christology, Trinitarian theology, and soteriological doctrine. The composer does not invent theological language but receives it from the Tradition, deploying inherited terminology with precision. Each council's distinctive vocabulary carries dogmatic weight and must be integrated without distortion.

**Usage Protocol**: When rendering any passage touching upon doctrines addressed by the councils, verify that all terminology conforms exactly to conciliar definitions. No synonym may substitute for a term that carries dogmatic weight. Homoousios cannot become "similar in essence." Theotokos cannot become "Christ bearer." The vocabulary is not stylistic preference but dogmatic precision.

# PART ONE: HISTORICAL OVERVIEW

## The Seven Ecumenical Councils

| Council | Year | Location | Central Controversy | Key Figures |
|---------|------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| First | 325 | Nicaea | Arianism | Athanasius, Arius, Constantine |
| Second | 381 | Constantinople | Macedonianism/Pneumatomachianism | Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa |
| Third | 431 | Ephesus | Nestorianism | Cyril of Alexandria, Nestorius |
| Fourth | 451 | Chalcedon | Eutychianism/Monophysitism | Leo of Rome, Dioscorus |
| Fifth | 553 | Constantinople | Three Chapters | Justinian, Theodore of Mopsuestia |
| Sixth | 680-681 | Constantinople | Monothelitism | Maximus the Confessor, Honorius |
| Seventh | 787 | Nicaea | Iconoclasm | John of Damascus, Irene |

## The Christological and Trinitarian Development

The councils addressed heresies in logical sequence. Nicaea I established the Son's divinity against Arius. Constantinople I extended this to the Spirit against Macedonius. Ephesus affirmed the unity of Christ's person against Nestorius who divided the natures. Chalcedon protected the distinction of natures against Eutyches who confused them. Constantinople II clarified the relationship between person and nature. Constantinople III affirmed two wills against those who collapsed Christ's human will into the divine. Nicaea II defended the depictability of Christ against those who denied that the Incarnation could be represented.

Each council's vocabulary builds upon its predecessors. The later councils presuppose the earlier; none can be understood in isolation. ΒΊΒΛΟΣ ΛΌΓΟΥ must deploy vocabulary from all seven councils in integrated harmony, never privileging one council's terminology at the expense of another's.

# PART TWO: THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICAEA (325)

## Historical Context

Emperor Constantine convened the council to address the teaching of Arius, a presbyter of Alexandria, who taught that the Son was a creature, the first and greatest of God's creations, but not eternal, not of the same essence as the Father. Arius's slogan was "There was when He was not" (ἦν ποτε ὅτε οὐκ ἦν). The council condemned Arianism and produced the first form of what would become the Nicene Creed.

## Essential Terminology

### ὁμοούσιος (homoousios)
**Definition**: Of one essence, of the same substance, consubstantial
**Greek**: ὁμοούσιος τῷ Πατρί (homoousios tō Patri) — consubstantial with the Father
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. This is the crux term of Nicaea, the word that distinguishes orthodoxy from Arianism.
**Usage**: Affirms that the Son shares the identical divine essence with the Father, not a similar essence (homoiousios), not a different essence (heteroousios), but the same essence.

**Compositional Integration**:
- Deploy in passages of explicit doctrinal crystallization
- Use when the Son's full divinity is at stake
- May appear in narrative descriptions of the Son's divine actions
- Always in contexts where distinction from creatures is emphasized

**Forbidden Substitutions**:
| Forbidden | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| "similar in essence" | Arian compromise (homoiousios) |
| "like the Father" | Too vague, permits Arian reading |
| "divine like the Father" | Permits graduated divinity |
| "of divine nature" | Does not specify identity of essence |

---

**Definition**: The Son is eternally generated from the Father's essence, not created from nothing
**Greek**: γεννηθέντα οὐ ποιηθέντα (gennēthenta ou poiēthenta)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Distinguishes eternal generation from temporal creation.

**Theological Precision**:
- "Begotten" (γεννηθέντα) indicates origin from the Father's essence
- "Made" (ποιηθέντα) indicates creation from nothing
- The Son is begotten eternally, not made in time
- Generation does not imply beginning; the Son is co-eternal with the Father

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages distinguishing Christ from creatures
- Deploy when discussing the eternal relationship of Father and Son
- Appropriate for theological reflection on divine generation

---

### ἐκ τῆς οὐσίας τοῦ Πατρός (from the essence of the Father)

- The source is not diminished by the proceeding
- The proceeding light is not inferior to the source
- Both are equally light, equally bright, equally illuminating

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages of illumination imagery
- Deploy in theophanic contexts where divine light appears
- Appropriate for Transfiguration, Resurrection appearances
- Connect to Palamite uncreated light theology

---

### θεὸν ἀληθινὸν ἐκ θεοῦ ἀληθινοῦ (true God from true God)
**Definition**: The Son is fully God, derived from the Father who is fully God
**Greek**: θεὸν ἀληθινὸν ἐκ θεοῦ ἀληθινοῦ (theon alēthinon ek theou alēthinou)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Creedal affirmation of full divinity.

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages affirming Christ's divinity
- Deploy when distinguishing true divinity from false gods

## Condemned Expressions

| Expression | Greek | Source | Reason Condemned |
|------------|-------|--------|------------------|
| "There was when He was not" | ἦν ποτε ὅτε οὐκ ἦν | Arius | Denies eternal existence of the Son |

# PART THREE: THE FIRST COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE (381)

## Historical Context

The council addressed the continuing Arian controversy and the new heresy of Macedonianism (Pneumatomachianism), which denied the full divinity of the Holy Spirit. The council expanded the Nicene Creed with the full article on the Holy Spirit and affirmed the Cappadocian Trinitarian formula: one essence (οὐσία), three hypostases (ὑποστάσεις).

## Essential Terminology

### τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, τὸ Κύριον, τὸ ζωοποιόν
**Definition**: The Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life
**Greek**: τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, τὸ Κύριον, τὸ ζωοποιόν (to Pneuma to Hagion, to Kyrion, to zōopoion)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Creedal affirmation of Spirit's divinity.

**Theological Precision**:
- "Lord" (Κύριον) is a divine title, applying to the Spirit the title applied to Father and Son

- The Son is begotten; the Spirit proceeds
- Both are eternal, neither is created
- The distinction is in mode of origin, not in essence or dignity

**Orthodox vs. Western Distinction**:
- Orthodox: proceeds from the Father alone (ἐκ μόνου τοῦ Πατρός)
- Western addition (Filioque): "and from the Son"
- ΒΊΒΛΟΣ ΛΌΓΟΥ follows Orthodox formulation exclusively

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages of Spirit's origin or mission
- Deploy when distinguishing Spirit from Son
- Never use Filioque formulation

---

### σὺν Πατρὶ καὶ Υἱῷ συμπροσκυνούμενον καὶ συνδοξαζόμενον

**Theological Precision**:
- The Spirit receives the same worship as Father and Son
- "Together with" (σύν) indicates equality, not subordination
- Worship and glory given to one is given to all three

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in doxological passages
- Deploy in liturgical contexts
- Appropriate for Trinitarian worship scenes

**Theological Precision**:
- οὐσία (ousia): what God is; the common divine nature
- ὑπόστασις (hypostasis): who God is; the distinct Persons
- The three Persons share one essence; the one essence subsists in three Persons
- Neither modalism (one Person in three modes) nor tritheism (three Gods)

# PART FOUR: THE COUNCIL OF EPHESUS (431)

## Historical Context

The council addressed the teaching of Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, who objected to calling Mary "Theotokos" (God-bearer), preferring "Christotokos" (Christ-bearer). Cyril of Alexandria led the opposition, arguing that denying Theotokos divided Christ into two persons. The council affirmed that Mary is Theotokos because the one born of her is the divine Person of the Son.

## Essential Terminology

### Θεοτόκος (Theotokos)
**Definition**: God-bearer, Mother of God
**Greek**: Θεοτόκος (Theotokos)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. The test word for Christological orthodoxy at Ephesus.

**Theological Precision**:
- Mary bore a Person, not a nature
- The Person she bore is the divine Son
- Therefore she is rightly called "God-bearer"
- This does not mean Mary is the origin of divinity
- It means the one born of her is God the Son incarnate

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in all Marian passages, especially Annunciation, Nativity
- Deploy as title of address to Mary
- Essential for Incarnation theology
- Connect to liturgical Marian hymnography

**Forbidden Substitutions**:
| Forbidden | Reason |

**Definition**: The union of divine and human natures in one Person
**Greek**: ἕνωσις καθ᾽ ὑπόστασιν (henōsis kath' hypostasin)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Defines the mode of Incarnational union.

**Theological Precision**:
- The union is not moral or relational but personal (hypostatic)
- Two natures, one Person (hypostasis)
- The Person is the eternal Son; the human nature is assumed
- The union is permanent, not temporary

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in Incarnation passages
- Deploy when emphasizing Christ's personal unity
- Essential for understanding Gospel narratives where one Person acts in two natures

---

### κοινωνία τῶν ἰδιωμάτων (communicatio idiomatum)
**Definition**: Communication of properties; attributes of either nature may be predicated of the one Person
**Latin**: communicatio idiomatum
**Greek**: κοινωνία τῶν ἰδιωμάτων / ἀντίδοσις τῶν ἰδιωμάτων (antidosis tōn idiōmatōn)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Enables proper Christological predication.

**Theological Precision**:
- Because there is one Person, what is true of either nature is true of the Person
- "God died" is true (the Person who is God died in His human nature)
- "This man created the world" is true (the Person who is man created in His divine nature)
- The predication crosses natures because the Person unites them

**Compositional Integration**:
- Apply divine predicates to human actions of Christ
- Apply human predicates to the divine Person
- Never separate what the Incarnation united
- Use when the Gospel narrates Christ's human experiences (hunger, thirst, suffering, death)

**Examples of Proper Predication**:
| Statement | Validity | Explanation |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| "God died on the Cross" | Valid | The Person who is God died in His human nature |
| "Mary gave birth to God" | Valid | The Person born is God the Son |
| "The Creator was hungry" | Valid | The Person who created experienced human hunger |
| "This man is eternal" | Valid | The Person who is man exists eternally as God |

---

### εἷς καὶ ὁ αὐτός (one and the same)
**Definition**: Affirmation that Christ is one and the same Person in both natures
**Greek**: εἷς καὶ ὁ αὐτός (heis kai ho autos)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Formula of personal identity.

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use when emphasizing continuity of Christ's identity
- Deploy when the same Person acts now divinely, now humanly
- Essential for narratives spanning pre-existence, Incarnation, glorification

| "Christotokos" (as rejection of Theotokos) | Χριστοτόκος | Implies Mary bore only a human person |
| "God-bearing man" | ἄνθρωπος θεοφόρος | Makes Christ a deified human, not incarnate God |
| "Conjunction" (mere moral union) | σύναφεια | Denies personal unity |
| "Two sons" | δύο υἱοί | Divides the one Christ |
| "The Word dwelt in Christ as in a temple" | — | Makes Christ a container, not the Word incarnate |
| Separation of communicatio idiomatum | — | Divides what cannot be divided |

# PART FIVE: THE COUNCIL OF CHALCEDON (451)

## Historical Context

The council addressed the opposite error from Nestorianism: Eutychianism, which taught that Christ's human nature was absorbed into or confused with His divine nature, resulting in one mixed nature. Eutyches said Christ was "from two natures" (ἐκ δύο φύσεων) but not "in two natures" (ἐν δύο φύσεσιν) after the union. The council affirmed two complete natures united in one Person without confusion, change, division, or separation.

## Essential Terminology

### The Four Chalcedonian Adverbs

These four adverbs define the mode of the hypostatic union and are dogmatically binding:

#### ἀσυγχύτως (without confusion)
**Definition**: The natures remain distinct, not merged into a third reality
**Greek**: ἀσυγχύτως (asynchytōs)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Protects distinction of natures.

**Against**: Eutychianism, which confused the natures into a hybrid
**Theological Precision**: Divinity remains fully divine; humanity remains fully human. The union does not create a tertium quid (third thing).

---

#### ἀτρέπτως (without change)
**Definition**: The natures are not altered by union
**Greek**: ἀτρέπτως (atreptōs)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Protects integrity of each nature.

**Against**: Any suggestion that divinity was humanized or humanity was divinized in the union
**Theological Precision**: The divine nature did not become less divine; the human nature did not become superhuman. Each nature retains its properties.

---

#### ἀδιαιρέτως (without division)
**Definition**: The Person is one, not split into separate subjects
**Greek**: ἀδιαιρέτως (adiairetōs)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Protects personal unity.

**Against**: Nestorianism, which divided the Person
**Theological Precision**: There are not two "I"s in Christ; there is one "I" who acts in two natures.

---

#### ἀχωρίστως (without separation)
**Definition**: The union is permanent, not temporary or dissoluble
**Greek**: ἀχωρίστως (achōristōs)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Protects permanence of Incarnation.

**Against**: Any suggestion that the Word could abandon the assumed humanity
**Theological Precision**: Once assumed, the human nature is united to the Person of the Son forever. Christ remains incarnate eternally.

---

**Compositional Integration for the Four Adverbs**:
- Distribute throughout relevant passages; never list together as a technical formula in narrative prose
- Deploy when describing Christ's actions in either nature
- Use when protecting both the distinction and unity of Christ
- Essential for Passion narratives where the one Person suffers in His human nature while remaining impassible in His divine nature

---

### ἐν δύο φύσεσιν (in two natures)
**Definition**: Christ exists in two natures after the union
**Greek**: ἐν δύο φύσεσιν (en duo physesin)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. The Chalcedonian formula against Eutychianism.

**Forbidden Formula**: ἐκ δύο φύσεων (ek duo physeōn) — "from two natures"
- "From two natures" suggests the natures merged into one
- "In two natures" affirms their continuing distinction

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use when emphasizing the continuing duality of natures
- Deploy against any suggestion of mixture or confusion
- Essential for understanding how the one Christ acts divinely and humanly

---

### φύσις (nature)
**Definition**: The "what" of a being; its essence or kind
**Greek**: φύσις (physis)

- The divine nature includes all divine attributes
- The human nature includes body, soul, mind, will

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use when distinguishing what Christ is from who Christ is
- Deploy when explaining how Christ can have contrary properties (eternal/temporal, infinite/finite)
- The natures explain the "what"; the Person explains the "who"

---

### ὑπόστασις / πρόσωπον (person)
**Definition**: The "who" of a being; the individual subject
**Greek**: ὑπόστασις (hypostasis) or πρόσωπον (prosōpon)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Technical term for personal identity.

**Theological Precision**:
- Christ is one Person (hypostasis/prosōpon)
- This Person is the eternal Son, the second Person of the Trinity
- The human nature does not constitute a separate person
- The human nature is enhypostatic (has its personal existence in the Person of the Son)

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use when emphasizing the unity of Christ's identity
- Deploy when showing how one subject acts in two natures
- Essential for maintaining that Christ is "someone," not "something"

---

### τέλειος ἐν θεότητι καὶ τέλειος ἐν ἀνθρωπότητι (perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity)

**Theological Precision**:
- "Perfect" (τέλειος) means complete, lacking nothing

- Christ's humanity lacks no human attribute (except sin)
- He is not partly God or partly human but fully both

**Compositional Integration**:

### ὁμοούσιον τῷ Πατρὶ κατὰ τὴν θεότητα, ὁμοούσιον ἡμῖν κατὰ τὴν ἀνθρωπότητα
**Definition**: Consubstantial with the Father according to divinity, consubstantial with us according to humanity
**Greek**: ὁμοούσιον τῷ Πατρὶ κατὰ τὴν θεότητα, ὁμοούσιον ἡμῖν κατὰ τὴν ἀνθρωπότητα
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Double homoousios.

**Theological Precision**:
- Christ shares the identical divine essence with the Father
- Christ shares the identical human essence with us
- He is truly God as the Father is God
- He is truly human as we are human (sin excepted)

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use when establishing Christ's solidarity with both God and humanity
- Deploy in salvation contexts: He bridges the gap because He is both
- Essential for understanding mediation

---

# PART SIX: THE SECOND COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE (553)

## Historical Context

Emperor Justinian convened the council to address the "Three Chapters" controversy: the writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrrhus (against Cyril), and Ibas of Edessa (letter to Maris). These were seen as Nestorian in tendency. The council condemned the Three Chapters while affirming Chalcedon, providing further precision on the hypostatic union.

## Essential Terminology

### μία ὑπόστασις τοῦ Θεοῦ Λόγου σεσαρκωμένη
**Definition**: One hypostasis of God the Word incarnate
**Greek**: μία ὑπόστασις τοῦ Θεοῦ Λόγου σεσαρκωμένη (mia hypostasis tou Theou Logou sesarkōmenē)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Clarifies the subject of the Incarnation.

**Theological Precision**:
- The subject of the Incarnation is the divine Person of the Word

- This avoids both Nestorianism (separate human person) and Apollinarianism (incomplete human nature)

**Compositional Integration**:

**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Identifies the incarnate one with the second Trinitarian Person.

**Theopaschite Implications**:
- "One of the Trinity suffered in the flesh"

# PART SEVEN: THE THIRD COUNCIL OF CONSTANTINOPLE (680-681)

## Historical Context

The council addressed Monothelitism, which taught that Christ had only one will (the divine will), denying that He had a human will. This was a compromise position attempting to reconcile Chalcedonians and Monophysites. The council affirmed that Christ has two wills (divine and human) and two operations, corresponding to His two natures. Maximus the Confessor was the theological champion of dyothelitism (two wills).

## Essential Terminology

### δύο θελήσεις (two wills)
**Definition**: Christ possesses both a divine will and a human will
**Greek**: δύο θελήσεις (duo thelēseis) or δύο θελήματα (duo thelēmata)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. The central affirmation of Constantinople III.

**Theological Precision**:
- Will belongs to nature, not to person
- Since Christ has two natures, He has two wills
- The divine will is the will He shares with Father and Spirit
- The human will is a complete human faculty of willing

**Against**: Monothelitism, which attributed only one will to Christ
**Maximus's Contribution**: Distinguished natural will (belonging to nature) from gnomic will (deliberative, potentially sinful). Christ has natural human will but not gnomic will (He never deliberates toward sin).

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in Gethsemane narrative especially
- Deploy when showing harmony of wills
- Essential for understanding obedience: human will freely submits to divine

---

### δύο ἐνέργειαι (two operations/activities)
**Definition**: Christ has two natural operations corresponding to His two natures
**Greek**: δύο ἐνέργειαι (duo energeiai)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Parallel to two wills.

**Theological Precision**:
- Operation/activity belongs to nature
- Divine operation: creating, sustaining, knowing all things
- Human operation: walking, eating, sleeping, dying
- One Person performs both operations through respective natures

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use when showing Christ acting divinely (miracles) and humanly (hunger)
- Deploy to explain how one Person does contradictory things
- Essential for understanding Gospel narratives

---

### τὸ ἀνθρώπινον θέλημα ἑπόμενον (the human will following)
**Definition**: The human will voluntarily subjects itself to the divine will
**Greek**: τὸ ἀνθρώπινον θέλημα ἑπόμενον (to anthrōpinon thelēma hepomenon)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Describes the harmony of wills.

**Theological Precision**:
- The human will is not absorbed, destroyed, or overridden
- It freely and voluntarily aligns with the divine will
- This is the model of deification: human will united to divine without destruction
- Gethsemane shows this: "Not my will but yours" is human will speaking

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages of Christ's obedience
- Deploy at Gethsemane, Temptation, throughout obedient life
- Model for Christian discipleship and theosis

---

### θεανδρική ἐνέργεια (theandric operation)
**Definition**: The "divine-human" operation of the one Christ
**Greek**: θεανδρική ἐνέργεια (theandrikē energeia)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Medium. Pseudo-Dionysian term requiring careful use.

**Theological Precision**:
- Does NOT mean one mixed operation
- Means the operations of both natures belong to one Person
- The one Christ operates divinely and humanly
- Orthodox interpretation: two operations united in one Person, not blended into one

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use carefully, with Orthodox interpretation
- Deploy when showing unity of Christ's action
- Never in a way suggesting mixture of operations

---

## Condemned Expressions (Monothelitism)

| Expression | Greek | Reason Condemned |
|------------|-------|------------------|
| "One will in Christ" | ἓν θέλημα | Denies human will |
| "One operation in Christ" | μία ἐνέργεια | Denies human operation |
| "The divine will replaced the human" | — | Apollinarian tendency |
| "Christ had no human faculty of willing" | — | Incomplete humanity |
| "The human will was passive" | — | Destroys genuine freedom |

**Pope Honorius**: The council condemned Honorius posthumously for his ambiguous statements that seemed to support Monothelitism. This demonstrates that even papal statements can be judged by councils.

## Constantinople III Vocabulary Integration Table

| Term | Mandatory Context | Forbidden Context |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| δύο θελήσεις | Christ's willing | Never ἓν θέλημα |
| δύο ἐνέργειαι | Christ's acting | Never μία ἐνέργεια |
| ἑπόμενον | Human will's voluntary submission | Never forced or absorbed |
| θεανδρική | Unity of operations | Never mixture of operations |

# PART EIGHT: THE SECOND COUNCIL OF NICAEA (787)

## Historical Context

The council addressed Iconoclasm, the movement that rejected the veneration of icons as idolatry. Emperor Leo III and Constantine V had promoted iconoclasm; their successors reversed it. The council, supported by Empress Irene, affirmed the legitimacy of icon veneration, grounding it in the theology of the Incarnation. John of Damascus was the great theologian of icon defense.

## Essential Terminology

### εἰκών (icon)
**Definition**: Image, visual representation of sacred prototype
**Greek**: εἰκών (eikōn)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Central to the council's theology.

**Theological Precision**:
- An icon is a material representation of a spiritual reality
- Icons of Christ are possible because God became visible in the Incarnation
- Icons of saints are possible because they participate in Christ's deified humanity
- The icon is not worshipped; it is a window to the prototype

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages of visual representation
- Deploy when discussing visibility of the invisible God
- Essential for understanding Incarnation's material implications

---

### πρωτότυπον (prototype)
**Definition**: The original reality depicted in the icon
**Greek**: πρωτότυπον (prōtotypon)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Technical term for icon theology.

**Theological Precision**:
- The prototype is the saint or Christ depicted
- The icon participates in the prototype without being identical to it
- Honor given to the icon passes to the prototype
- The relationship is not magical but participatory

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use when explaining icon veneration
- Deploy in passages distinguishing image from reality
- Essential for understanding how material can mediate spiritual

---

### τιμητικὴ προσκύνησις (honorable veneration)
**Definition**: The reverent honor given to icons, distinct from worship
**Greek**: τιμητικὴ προσκύνησις (timētikē proskynēsis)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Distinguishes icon veneration from idolatry.

**Theological Precision**:
- προσκύνησις can mean various levels of honor
- τιμητικὴ προσκύνησις is relative honor, passing through to prototype
- It is NOT λατρεία (worship due to God alone)
- The distinction is crucial: veneration of icons is not worship of images

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in all passages of icon veneration
- Deploy when characters honor sacred images
- Always distinguish from worship

---

### λατρεία (worship)
**Definition**: The worship due to God alone
**Greek**: λατρεία (latreia)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Defines the boundary icons cannot cross.

**Theological Precision**:
- λατρεία is reserved exclusively for the Holy Trinity
- Icons never receive λατρεία
- The distinction between προσκύνησις and λατρεία is dogmatic
- Giving λατρεία to icons would be idolatry

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages of divine worship
- Deploy when distinguishing true worship from false
- Essential for maintaining proper order of veneration

---

### ἡ τιμὴ τῆς εἰκόνος ἐπὶ τὸ πρωτότυπον διαβαίνει
**Definition**: The honor of the icon passes to the prototype
**Greek**: ἡ τιμὴ τῆς εἰκόνος ἐπὶ τὸ πρωτότυπον διαβαίνει (hē timē tēs eikonos epi to prōtotypon diabainei)
**Dogmatic Weight**: Maximum. Foundational principle of icon veneration.

**Theological Precision**:
- The icon is not honored for its own sake
- Honor given to the image is honor given to the one depicted
- This applies to icons of Christ, Mary, saints, angels
- The material image mediates relationship with spiritual reality

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages explaining icon veneration
- Deploy when showing proper attitude toward sacred images
- Essential for understanding how matter can be sanctified

---

### περιγραπτός (circumscribable)
**Definition**: Capable of being visually represented, bounded
**Greek**: περιγραπτός (perigraptos)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Christological term in icon debate.

**Theological Precision**:
- Christ's divine nature is not circumscribable (ἀπερίγραπτος)
- Christ's human nature is circumscribable (bounded, visible, depictable)
- Because Christ has a real human nature, He can be depicted
- To deny His depictability denies His true humanity

**Against**: Iconoclasts who argued Christ cannot be depicted
**John of Damascus's Argument**: The one who denies Christ's depictability denies His Incarnation

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use in passages about Christ's visible human nature
- Deploy when defending material expressions of faith
- Essential for understanding Incarnation's material implications

---

### σχετική (relative)
**Definition**: Relative honor, as distinguished from absolute honor
**Greek**: σχετική (schetikē)
**Dogmatic Weight**: High. Describes the mode of icon veneration.

**Theological Precision**:
- Honor to icons is relative (directed through the image to the prototype)
- Honor to God is absolute (directed to God Himself)
- Relative honor is entirely appropriate for icons
- The icon mediates; it is not an end in itself

**Compositional Integration**:
- Use when explaining how icon veneration works
- Deploy in passages distinguishing types of honor
- Essential for understanding proper piety

---

| Expression | Source | Reason Condemned |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| "Icon veneration is idolatry" | Iconoclasts | Denies distinction of προσκύνησις and λατρεία |

---

## Compositional Integration Protocols

### Protocol for Christological Passages

1. **Identify the Christological content**: Is this passage about Christ's identity, nature(s), will(s), actions, or depictability?

2. **Determine which councils are relevant**: Most Christological passages implicate multiple councils.

3. **Verify terminology**: Check all terms against the vocabulary tables above.

4. **Check for inadvertent heresy**: Run through the heresy detection patterns.

5. **Confirm cross-conciliar consistency**: Ensure no council's teaching is violated.

6. **Maintain proper predication**: Apply communicatio idiomatum correctly.

### Protocol for Trinitarian Passages

1. **Identify the Trinitarian content**: Is this about the relationships of Persons, the common essence, or economic missions?

2. **Verify Nicene and Constantinopolitan terminology**: Homoousios, procession, one essence/three hypostases.

3. **Avoid subordinationism**: No Person is less divine than another.

4. **Avoid modalism**: The Persons are really distinct, not modes of one Person.

5. **Avoid tritheism**: There is one God, not three Gods.

### Protocol for Marian Passages

1. **Use Theotokos**: Never replace with Christotokos alone.

2. **Ground in Christology**: Theotokos is a Christological, not merely Mariological, title.

3. **Maintain proper veneration**: Mary receives τιμητικὴ προσκύνησις, not λατρεία.

### Protocol for Icon/Image Passages

1. **Distinguish veneration from worship**: Use proper vocabulary.

2. **Ground in Incarnation**: The depictability of Christ follows from His true humanity.

3. **Emphasize the prototype**: Honor passes through the image to the one depicted.
