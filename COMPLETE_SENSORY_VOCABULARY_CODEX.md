# COMPLETE SENSORY VOCABULARY CODEX

## ΒΊΒΛΟΣ ΛΌΓΟΥ Compositional Reference

This document specifies the exact sensory vocabulary for every biblical reality in the ΒΊΒΛΟΣ ΛΌΓΟΥ project. Each entry provides mandatory vocabulary across six modalities: Visual, Auditory, Tactile, Olfactory, Gustatory, and Proprioceptive. Vocabulary consistency across the work's 10,500,000 words enables subliminal pattern recognition through identical neural activation at type and antitype locations.

**Usage Protocol**: When rendering any biblical reality listed below, deploy vocabulary from the appropriate entry. Substitution of synonyms breaks the neural pattern recognition that creates subliminal connection across thousands of pages. "Rough hemp" is not interchangeable with "coarse rope." The brain recognizes exact lexical matches; it does not recognize semantic equivalents as the same pattern.
